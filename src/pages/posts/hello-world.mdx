## Hello from the Universe!

Like the title of this post says, I am the universe. Until someone tells me different this is the official line 
I am taking. 

How did I come to the conclusion I am that universe? Well that is pretty simple. I was born in this universe and
am a product of the universe and made from things that are in the universe. Which leads to I am a human incarnation 
of the universe. Luckily I'm not the only one. You my friend are also lucky to be a human incarnation of the universe
as well.

Well then this leaves me with a question. If I am the universe then I am everything. If I am everything then am I nothing?

I don't really know nor care about that.

Anyways until next time

R.D.
